## 🛠️ Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This Chrome extension is a **prompt manager for LLM services**, and we're happy to have contributors help make it better.

### ✅ What You Can Contribute

- **Bug fixes** – eliminate known issues or edge cases
- **Feature improvements** – improve existing features for usability or performance
- **New features** – build something genuinely useful and relevant
- **Minor styling tweaks** – small adjustments are okay (e.g., spacing, alignment)
- **Small-scale refactoring** – cleanup of specific areas is welcome

### 🚫 Please Avoid

- **Large refactors** – avoid rewriting the entire codebase unless there's a strong, well-justified reason
- **Major styling changes** – we aim to keep styling minimal and consistent

### 🧠 Before You Start

- **Open an issue first** – describe the bug or feature idea
  - This keeps everyone on the same page
  - I can provide guidance, feedback, or a heads-up if it's already in progress

### 🤝 Need Help?

I'm always available for consultation. Just create an issue or reach out directly in the thread.

Looking forward to your contributions!
